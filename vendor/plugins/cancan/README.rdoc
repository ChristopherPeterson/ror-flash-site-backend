= CanCan

Wiki[https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/wiki] | RDocs[http://rdoc.info/projects/ryanb/cancan] | Screencast[http://railscasts.com/episodes/192-authorization-with-cancan]

CanCan is an authorization library for Ruby on Rails which restricts what resources a given user is allowed to access. All permissions are defined in a single location (the +Ability+ class) and not duplicated across controllers, views, and database queries.


== Installation

In <b>Rails 3</b>, add this to your Gemfile.

  gem "cancan"

In <b>Rails 2</b>, add this to your environment.rb file.

  config.gem "cancan"

Alternatively, you can install it as a plugin.

  rails plugin install git://github.com/ryanb/cancan.git


== Getting Started

CanCan expects a +current_user+ method to exist in controllers. If you have not already, set up some authentication (such as Authlogic[https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic] or Devise[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise]). See {Changing Defaults}[https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/wiki/changing-defaults] if you need different behavior.

Next create a class called +Ability+ in "models/ability.rb" or anywhere else in the load path. It should look similar to this.

  class Ability
    include CanCan::Ability

    def initialize(user)
      if user.admin?
        can :manage, :all
      else
        can :read, :all
      end
    end
  end

The +current_user+ is passed in to this method which is where the abilities are defined. See {Defining Abilities}[https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/wiki/defining-abilities] for what can go here.

The current user's permissions can then be accessed using the "can?" and "cannot?" methods in the view and controller.

  <% if can? :update, @article %>
    <%= link_to "Edit", edit_article_path(@article) %>
  <% end %>

See {Checking Abilities}[https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/wiki/checking-abilities] for more information

The "authorize!" method in the controller will raise an exception if the user is not able to perform the given action.

  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    authorize! :read, @article
  end

Setting this for every action can be tedious, therefore the +load_and_authorize_resource+ method is provided to automatically authorize all actions in a RESTful style resource controller. It will use a before filter to load the resource into an instance variable and authorize it for each action.

  class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
    load_and_authorize_resource

    def show
      # @article is already loaded and authorized
    end
  end

See {Authorizing Controller Actions}[https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/wiki/authorizing-controller-actions] for more information

If the user authorization fails, a <tt>CanCan::AccessDenied</tt> exception will be raised. You can catch this and modify its behavior in the +ApplicationController+.

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    rescue_from CanCan::AccessDenied do |exception|
      flash[:alert] = exception.message
      redirect_to root_url
    end
  end

== Questions or Problems?

If you have any issues with CanCan which you cannot find the solution to in the documentation, please add an {issue on GitHub}[https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/issues] or fork the project and send a pull request.

To get the specs running you should call +bundle+ and then +rake+. Specs currently do not work in Ruby 1.9 due to the RR mocking framework. See the {spec/README}[https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/blob/master/spec/README.rdoc] for more information.
